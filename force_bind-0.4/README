-----------------------

Name:		force_bind

Author:		Catali(ux) M. BOIE - catab at embedromix dot ro

Start date:	2010-10-26

Description:	Force binding on a specific IP and/or port.
		Works with both IPv4 and IPv6.
		It is useful if you have a binary application without sources
		and without the possibility to configure address or port to
		bind to.

License:	GPLv3

How it works:	force_bind is a shared object that is loaded with LD_PRELOAD and hooks 'bind' function.
		Forcing an IP/port to bind to is done with environments variables.

Examples:
		1. FORCE_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1 FORCE_BIND_PORT=33 LD_PRELOAD=${LD_PRELOAD}:/usr/lib/force_bind.so your_program # force binding to 127.0.0.1/33.
		2. FORCE_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.2 LD_PRELOAD=${LD_PRELOAD}:/usr/lib/force_bind.so your_program # force binding to 127.0.0.2

Installation:
		- ./configure
		- make
		- make install
